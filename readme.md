# rust utils

A variety of utilities, mostly for bioinformatics, written in rust.

Each subfolder is its own crate.

## Building and running

Download and install [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, in a crate subfolder, build the binary:

    cargo build --release

The executable is then in the `target/release/` directory in the crate.
